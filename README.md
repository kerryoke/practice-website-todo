This project was to practice implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a simple to-do list website. 
I used W3 Schools (particularly https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp) for help with the Javascript. Some things remain commented out because I was experimenting with how I wanted my own site to look, and not just make it a copy of the W3 Schools version.
The overall goal was to create a website where the user can add items to a to-do list and then check them off.
I was able to make it so a user could add items but I struggled with crossing off items other than just using the checkbox style which I left in as an example.
I would like to return to this site to improve on the look and usability in the future, but it served as good practice.
